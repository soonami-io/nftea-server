              <h1>Story of the nft<span>ea</span></h1>
              <p>
                Once upon a time, in a land where teas were kings, six unique
                ones lived together in harmony. Black tea, White tea, Green tea,
                Rooibos tea, Pu-erh tea, and Oolong tea each had their own
                special qualities and lived in separate tea gardens, content
                with their daily routines. But one day, they heard whispers of a
                revolutionary new world, a place where they could become more
                than just tea - the world of Web3.
              </p>
              <p>
                Excited by the prospect of becoming something truly unique, the
                teas decided to embark on a journey together to discover this
                magical land. Along the way, they gathered special ingredients
                to enhance their flavours and make themselves stand out from the
                rest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, they arrived at the entrance to the Web3 world - a
                sprawling marketplace filled with opportunities and challenges.
                As they explored this new and exciting place, they discovered
                that they could use blockchain technology to create unique
                digital representations of themselves, each with their own
                special blend of ingredients.
              </p>
              <p>
                The teas worked tirelessly, perfecting their digital creations
                and blending themselves with the finest ingredients. And soon,
                they were transformed into living, breathing pieces of art, each
                with its own unique flavour and personality.
              </p>
              <p>
                As they explored the Web3 world, they encountered other digital
                creations and formed friendships with them. They learned that
                they could trade their digital representations with others and
                that their creations would live forever, becoming a part of
                Web3's rich history.
              </p>
              <p>
                And so, the six teas lived happily ever after, continuing to
                explore the wonders of web3 and sharing their unique creations
                with the world. They knew that they would never forget their
                journey and the lessons they had learned along the way.

                came to soonami with an intriguing idea of utilizing their
                quality teas and unique style to raise funds for those in need
                through the power of blockchains and NFTs. We were only too
                happy to oblige and just as we completed the project we couldn’t
                think of a more worthwhile cause than the current tragedy after
                an earthquake in Turkey.
